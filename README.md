# sim_poc

Simple proof of concept for the AP/RT simulator

The docker-compose file `docker-compose.yaml` sets up a network with 5 containers. Each container simulates one AP with
100 RTs by assinging a unique IP address to each node. Then a single fastapi server connects to all IP addresses in the
network and provides an endpoint `/which_ip` which returns the IP address on which the request was received.

In `utils` you can find two helper scripts:

- `gen_compose.py` generates the `docker-compose.yaml` file based on the number of APs and RTs you want to simulate.
- `test_ipv6_which_ip.py` is a simple test script that sends requests to all of the simulated APs to check that the
  `/which_ip` endpoint returns a 200 OK response and the correct IP address.
